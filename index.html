            <p>
                This problem is not only limited to NYC but everywhere else in the world. It creates a gap between social
                classes, which depends on various factors such as population, majority ethnicity/race, historical past,
                average income, education, and jobs.

                <p>Income inequality affects many communities, especially in urban areas like NYC. It creates economic and

                <p>
                    Income differentiation hits hard on urban communities, especially in NYC, creating conflicting economic
                    and social conditions between the upper and lower classes. Some reasons for income inequality include a
                    lack of affordable housing, low-quality education, and historical factors.
